# fish_feeder
Arduino based fish feeder using a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor

I have created this code for a fish feeder I have printed from an existing Thingiverse project.

The 3D printed project can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2959685).

In the code, there is two machine states. On managing the scheduled task and another sub-machine state that runs while doing the waiting task to indicate the remaining time before the next feed.
